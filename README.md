# Tableau Presentation - Influemza Season

# Goal

To help a medical staffing agency that provides temporary workers to clinics 
and hospitals on an as-needed basis. The analysis will help plan for influenza 
season, a time when additional staff are in high demand. The final results will 
examine trends in influenza and how they can be used to proactively plan for 
staffing needs across the country. 

# Business Requirements

As an analyst, you need technical skills to analyze your data and soft skills to communicate your 
insights to stakeholders. You’ll start by distilling business requirements and requests into questions 
you can answer with an analysis. You’ll follow up by sourcing and curating the data to address these 
questions. After analyzing the data and drawing conclusions or formulating recommendations from 
your results, you’ll present your insights to stakeholders in an easily consumable format.  
You’ll find the requirements for your project below. These requirements are what should guide your 
approach to the analysis. While this project will use data from healthcare, the steps and framework 
involved can be used for projects in any domain.  
```
Analysis Criteria

● You must explain what cleaning you conduct on the data. 
● You must select and integrate at least two relevant data sets from different sources. 
● You must identify or create a hypothesis that you then test with the data. 
● You must look at the relationship between variables with at least one correlation found. 
● You must include spatial and temporal visualizations in your final deliverable. 
● You must include your conclusions, recommendations, and proposed next steps in your final 
presentation. 
● You must consider the audience when determining which analysis components to include in 
your final presentation.

3. Population data by geography

NOTE: keep in mind that these numbers are estimates, hence the sum of the 
numbers from the different age groups may not sum up to the total in the first 
columns, but that’s totally okay. 

5. Counts of influenza laboratory test results by state (survey)
